/*

 *
 * The top sequence of two blocks a1 and a2 must share a same region
 * (same specie, overlapped regions). a1 and a2 are two blocks to be
 * aligned from beg to end, which are positions(not in respect to the
 * block) on the top reference sequence for each block.

 * pre_yama aligns columns of a1 and a2 from beg to end corresponding
 * to positions beg-end to the columns of a1 corresponding to positions
 * beg-end to the columns of a2, using the top reference sequence to
 * determine an approximation to the result.

 * The block is always topped by a reference, for being used to determine
 * the approximate alignment, but the referece is fixed in that block
 * or not, depending on the argument of reference:
 *     0:  neither is fixed
 *     1:  the first block is fixed
