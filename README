Add refsrc=src option to maf2fasta.  The default is to use the
source of the first component of the first alignment block in the
maf file.

-- See README2 for more updated programs.  10/12/05

-- big revisions 1/13/05

--modified on 11/23/04
add a switch to maf_order to keep single-row alignment or not.

--modified on 11/22/04
added program descriptions.

--modified on 11/02/04
maf_order is added. 

README version 10 -- modified on 11/01/04
add a small tool "get_standard_headers", which return in format of
"1:end:+:srcSize" assuming the sequence contig starts at position
1. The start position in fasta header is inclusive while the end
position is exclusive, so the srcSize is one larger than end. 

README version 10 -- modified on 10/26/04
-- maf2lav and maf2fasta allow the species with more than one contigs. 
Parameters are the same as before.    

README version 10 -- modified on 10/25/04
-- Multiz maf_Project maf_project_simple programs are removed.
-- all_bz multiz programs no longer need mapping file. 

README version 10 -- modofied on 10/09/04
-- Var_multiz program becomes Multiz version 10.
-- var_multiz program becomes multiz version 10.

|		Some requirements			|
---------------------------------------------------------
*1. format of sequence header:

>string1:string2:int1:char:int3

Note:
string1 is usually species name, string2 is usually chromosome 
information. "string1.string2" is used as src field in maf struct.

int1 is start position(1 based, inclusive).
int3 is src size. 
char is +/-.

It's allowed not to contain standard header as long as there is 
only one contig in the sequence file.


*2. MSA header can also be accepted.
">${COMMON_NAME}|${ENCODE_REGION}|${FREEZE_DATE}|${NCBI_TAXON_ID}
|${ASSEMBLY_PROVIDER}|${ASSEMBLY_DATE}|${ASSEMBLY_ID}|${CHROMOSOME}
|${CHROMOSOME_START}|${CHROMOSOME_END}|${CHROM_LENGTH}|${STRAND}
|${ACCESSION}.${VERSION}|${NUM_BASES}|${NUM_N}|${THIS_CONTIG_NUM}
|${TOTAL_NUM_CONTIGS}|${OTHER_COMMENTS}

empty field shall be represented by ".".

*3. mafFile component positions start at 0 instead of 1. 

*4. species-guid-tree is used as arugment in many of the 
following programs, it consists of double quotes, parenthesis,
and species names, e.g.  "((HUMAN CHIMP)(RAT MOUSE))"

multiz [R=?] [M=?] maf-file1 maf-file2 v [out1] [out2] [nohead]

multiz version 10 allows each species containing more than one 
contigs without reqirement for mapping-file. 
 
maf-file1 and maf-file2 are two maf files to be aligned, each 
topped by a same reference sequence. The alignment of reference 
sequence with other components might be just for purpose of 
determing approximate alignment between two files, thus the 
alignment might be fixed or not, this is specified by v value, 
which can be only 0 or 1.

0 - neither alignment of reference in each file is fixed.
1 - the alignment of reference in the first file is fixed.

[R=?] species radius values in dynamic programming, by default 30
[M=?] species minimum output width, by default 1, which means 
output all blocks.

[out1] collects unused blocks from maf-file1
[out2] collects unused blocks from maf-file2
[nohead] specifies not to have maf header for output
